Burning the midnight oil, they call it! Midnight's a normal night for you, but this paper you've been writing for your professor has taken you many hours past that. After a miserable, exhausting night, you crawled into your bed for a few hours of rest before handing the beast in. You aren't having class today, but your professor said you should bring the paper to his office and hand it in to him by the time your class would normally begin. Morning approaches...

Paper Route
An Interactive Fiction by Paul Broyles
Release 3 / Serial number 180527 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Your dorm room (in your bed)
The ceiling of your dorm room stares down at you, as it does most mornings. Out of the corners of your eyes, you make out a sea of chaos around you. The plain, unmarked ceiling is reassuring by comparison.

Your dorm room
Your room is a mess--hardly surprising, given the all-nighter you pulled. books and papers are strewn everywhere. To the north, your room door leads to the main hallway.

You can see your ID card half sticking out under the piles of stuff on your desk.

Your computer sits in the middle of the desk, a blank spot at the eye of the storm.

You can see your bed (empty) and your roommate's bed (in which is your roommate) here.

Grassy area
A large grassy expanse lies in front of the dorm. A quiet footpath meanders north toward your professor's office. A street runs to the northeast.

A bus from the campus transit system sits next to the curb.

A student lies sprawled on a blanket on the grass, studying.

You can also see a bicycle here.

You feel a sudden surge of panic. You glance at your wrist, but of course you never wear a watch. Still, you have this sudden feeling that you're running out of time. You'd better get the paper in fast!

The bus goes northeast.

A large grassy expanse lies in front of the dorm. A quiet footpath meanders north toward your professor's office. A street runs to the northeast.

A bus from the campus transit system sits next to the curb.

A student lies sprawled on a blanket on the grass, studying.

You can also see a bicycle here.

You can hear bells in the distance, their melodious chime floating across campus on the breeze. The deadline is here.

Professor's office
The professor's office seems to overflow with learning. Bookshelves line the walls, filled with tomes bearing obscure and incomprehensible titles.

You're jerked awake a short time later by a sharp pounding at the door. Your head throbs as you stumble blearily over to open it. You feel very small next to the towering figures silhouetted against the too-bright light of the hallway. "We've got some questions for you," one of the police officers says gruffly. "About your attacks on the hard-working student and the grad student." Your stomach sinks. You're certainly not going to back to sleep now.

The process drags on over several months. In the end, you don't face criminal charges, but you're dismissed from the university, and you're working to pay a hefty financial settlement to the students you assaulted. In retrospect, failing your paper doesn't sound so bad.

Several weeks later, you finally hear about your paper. You handed it in late, so you received a penalty. You get the feeling that by the time you handed in your paper, your professor was a little annoyed with you, and it showed in the grading. In the end, after all that work, your grade on the paper is B-.

You strain your ears for the whirring sounds of paper and ink nozzles. Nothing. Err...

It slowly dawns on you that you don't actually own a printer. But it's clearly printed to somewhere. If only you weren't too tired to remember where.

computer lab
The computer lab is full of stacks of cash--except the stacks of cash take the shape of shiny new computers. On a table near the front there's a printer with a pay box next to it. There's a stapler on the table as well. The large glass door leads back east to the main hallway.

You can see the computer lab door and a table here.
