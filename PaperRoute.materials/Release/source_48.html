Here, I use the scene to add some pressure: once the first set of puzzles is complete and the player has made it outside, we start a timer, and the paper is then late if the player can't get it in on time.]</span></p><p class="indent0">Paper Rush begins when the player is in Grassy area. &quot;<span class="quote">You feel a sudden surge of panic. You glance at your wrist, but of course you never wear a watch. Still, you have this sudden feeling that you're running out of time. You'd better get the paper in fast!</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Paper Rush ends when Paper Rush has been happening for 15 turns.</p><p class="indent0">When Paper Rush ends:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">You can hear bells in the distance, their melodious chime floating across campus on the breeze. The deadline is here. [</span><span class="substitution">run paragraph on</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">if the paper is nowhere or the paper is in the mailboxes:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">You breathe a sigh of relief at having gotten your paper in.</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">otherwise:</p><p class="indent2">say &quot;<span class="quote">A wave of crushing disappointment floods through you as you realize you've failed to get the paper in on time. Still, you must press on: a late penalty is better than no grade at all.</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent2">now the paper is late.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of waiting while Paper Rush is happening, say &quot;<span class="quote">Time passes. But can you really afford to waste time when your paper is due so soon?</span>&quot;. <span class="comment">[To add flavor to the scene, we can change how one of the actions works while it's going on.]</span></p><p class="indent1"></p>
