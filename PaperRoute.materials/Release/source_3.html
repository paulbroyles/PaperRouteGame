Designating doors as scenery prevents this; the word USUALLY allows us to exempt individual doors, as we do in the office building. (If I didn't want to exempt any doors, I would say ALL instead.]</span></p><p class="indent0">A door can be knocked on. A door is usually not knocked on. <span class="comment">[Here we give doors an optional property, allowing us to record and look up whether any given door has been knocked on. Note that we must set this property ourselves; it doesn't happen automatically.]</span></p><p class="indent0">A person can be beaten. A person is usually not beaten.</p><p class="indent0">A person has a number called annoyance. Annoyance is usually 0. <span class="comment">[This allows us to quantify something about an object--in this case a person. We give every person a numeric annoyance level, which we can then manipulate.]</span></p><p class="indent0">Definition: A person is not-annoyed if his annoyance is 0.<span class="comment">[This line and the next ones let us translate that annoyance level into words by defining custom adjectives. We can then make decisions based on whether a person is somewhat-annoyed or not annoyed.]</span></p><p class="indent0">Definition: A person is somewhat-annoyed if his annoyance is 1 or more.</p><p class="indent0">Definition: A person is very-annoyed if his annoyance is 3 or more.</p>
