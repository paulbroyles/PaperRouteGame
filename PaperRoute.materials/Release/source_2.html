We create specific objects of each kind later in the game, and they automatically have all the characteristics we assign here.]</span></p><p class="indent0">A window is a kind of thing. A window is always scenery. A window is always fixed in place. A window can be open or closed. A window is usually closed. A window can be openable or unopenable. A window is usually openable. <span class="comment">[This definition is borrowed from §11.17 of the Inform documentation. The authors of the documentation invite you to borrow examples without credit, but for our class, you should note any borrowings in comments; a citation like the previous sentence is fine.]</span></p><p class="indent0">A bed is a kind of container. A bed is always enterable. A bed is always fixed in place. <span class="comment">[Later, we make two beds, but Inform doesn't feature a built-in category of beds. It's useful to have this vocabulary because both beds which share the property of being ENTERABLE, so it would be nice to have a faster way of doing it. We can do so using the IS A KIND OF instruction, which allows us to create our own kinds. Now we can create new beds using IS A BED. The ENTERABLE property simply means a person can get into it. You can make anything enterable, so you have to consider what makes sense; you wouldn't want to allow the player to enter the ID card, for instance. Note that I've made the bed a supporter because you might want to sit on it, or put something on it, as well as getting into it; however, in this game, nothing special will happen when you do.]</span></p><p class="indent0">A swiper is a kind of thing. Swipers are never portable. <span class="comment">[Some doors and objects are controlled by using your swipe card. We need some way to control them: here, we create a kind of object called a swiper, and give it the swipable property. Note that &quot;swipable&quot; has no meaning whatsoever to Inform, and we could have used any word we wanted. By creating this property, we can now write rules about swipe boxes. &quot;Portable&quot; is a property we've already met; since all swipers are fixed in place, we specify this.]</span></p><p class="indent0">Does the player mean swiping the ID card in a swiper: it is likely. <span class="comment">[This offers the game some clarification. If the player issues a vague command involving swiping, it may be unclear what the player intends to swipe with, or what she intends to swipe it in. This line tells the game that unless there's a good reason to believe differently, the player is probably talking about swiping the ID card in something of the kind SWIPER. So just typing a command like &quot;swipe card&quot; in the hallway will trigger the hallway swipe box or in the computer lab will trigger the printer pay station, exactly as the player would probably expect.]</span></p>
