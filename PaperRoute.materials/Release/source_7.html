A DEVICE is a special kind of object that can be turned on or off. We explicitly say that it's switched off to set its condition at the start of play. Because we don't have to move the computer around, we don't have to say explicitly that it's on the desk, but this would be important if we wanted to be able to put it in different places.]</span></p><p class="indent0">The description of the computer is &quot;<span class="quote">It's a slightly battered laptop that you use to do almost all your work. [</span><span class="substitution">if the computer is switched off</span><span class="quote">]It's off right now. How come the computer gets to sleep?[</span><span class="substitution">else if the computer is switched on</span><span class="quote">]The screen glows with a familiar warmth.[</span><span class="substitution">else</span><span class="quote">]It is SchrÃ¶dinger's computer, neither off nor on, yet somehow both. Are you a physics major?[</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">if the paper is found and the paper is not queued and the computer is switched on</span><span class="quote">] Your paper is displayed on the screen. Perhaps you should try [</span><span class="substitution">bold type</span><span class="quote">]printing the paper[</span><span class="substitution">roman type</span><span class="quote">]?[</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;. <span class="comment">[The state of the computer will change once the interactor turns it on, so we want to be able to describe it differently. That's what the bracketed IF instructions do. Note that we could just have done &quot;if the computer is turned on / else&quot;, as any computer that is not on is off; I included the third description only to show you how you could use the &quot;if&quot; instruction when there are more than two conditions.]</span></p><p class="indent0">Understand &quot;<span class="quote">laptop</span>&quot; as the computer. <span class="comment">[In our description, we described the computer as a laptop, so it would be perfectly reasonable for an interactor to refer to it in that way. This instruction tells our program that any mentions of a laptop refer to the computer.]</span></p><p class="indent0">Instead of taking the computer, say &quot;<span class="quote">You're pretty sure your professor wouldn't just accept it if you handed in your whole computer; you'll need a copy of your essay on paper.</span>&quot; <span class="comment">[We could just have said the computer isn't portable, but this might have puzzled an interactor who could very reasonably expect to carry it around. Besides, maybe we'd want the interactor to be able to take it later in the game. The INSTEAD instruction allows us to interrupt Inform's default behavior and replace it with something else; in this case, we display a message.]</span></p><p class="indent0">Instead of doing anything except examining or switching on to the computer when the computer is switched off, say &quot;<span class="quote">You poke grumpily at some keys, but nothing happens. Oh, it's still turned off. No wonder.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of using the computer, say &quot;<span class="quote">You know, there are so many ways to use a computer! You could check Facebook, or play a game, or... No. What you need right now is your paper. You know it's in there somewhere; you just aren't sure where.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of searching the computer:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">Your fingers fly across the keys as exciting music swells in the background. You found the paper! You are a hacker genius! Or at least you know how to work the search box. Now, to get it out of the computer...</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">now the paper is found.</p><p class="indent1"></p>
