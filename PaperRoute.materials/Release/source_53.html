Normally when the player asks to print the paper, the game will complain, because the player is trying to do something to the paper, but the paper isn't in the room. Adjusting the scope of the paper is a way around that, but we have to be careful, or the player will be able to do other things to the paper as well.]</span></p><p class="indent0">Instead of laserprinting something when the computer is not visible, say &quot;<span class="quote">Your mother may accuse you of living online, but you don't really, so you can't print anything without having your computer in front of you.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of laserprinting something when the computer is switched off, say &quot;<span class="quote">You know, they call them electronic devices because they need electricity. Without that, they're just big boxes of... Oh, anyway, there's no way to print with the computer off.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of laserprinting something that is not the paper, say &quot;<span class="quote">The only thing you have due today is that paper, so there's no point printing anything else!</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of laserprinting the paper when the paper is not found for the first time, say &quot;<span class="quote">You'll have to find your paper before you can print it.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of laserprinting the paper when the paper is not found, say &quot;<span class="quote">You still haven't found the paper.
