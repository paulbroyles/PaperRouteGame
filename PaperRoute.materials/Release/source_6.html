The description is &quot;<span class="quote">Piles of books lie where you discarded them as you finished. Some are still open.</span>&quot; Instead of doing anything except examining to the books, say &quot;<span class="quote">You're finished with those; there's certainly no time to add anything else to your paper now.</span>&quot; <span class="comment">[This should all look familiar. The only new thing here is that we've defined the books as SCENERY. Scenery is a special kind of object. If other objects are like props in a play, scenery is like the set. It cannot ever be taken, and it isn't included in the room descriptions Inform generates automatically, though we can manually include it in our room descriptions, as we did above. It's a good idea to use scenery for things that you need to describe but that aren't important and can't be interacted with. In this case, interactors who read our room description might think they need to do something with the books. By including them as scenery, we're able to describe them so they can be EXAMINED, and to let the interactor know they aren't actually important.]</span></p><p class="indent0">The ceiling is scenery in your dorm room. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The ceiling is plain, unmarked, and utterly uninteresting, yet you're somehow capable of staring at it for hours at a time in the morning.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Some papers are scenery in your room. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">Bits of paper are strewn around the room. Some contain your notes, others portions of drafts. Some have bizarre sketches you can't remember doodling. Ah, 3 A.M.</span>&quot; Instead of doing anything except examining to the papers, say &quot;<span class="quote">You fiddle with the papers, but you're pretty sure a full copy of your paper is not among them.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">A mess is scenery in your dorm room. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">You can barely stand to look at this mess.</span>&quot; Instead of doing anything except examining to the mess, say &quot;<span class="quote">You just can't face it right now.</span>&quot;</p>
