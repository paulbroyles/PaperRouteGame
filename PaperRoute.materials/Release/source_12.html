Your professor is quite firm about deadlines, and he's not going to take any excuses.</span>&quot; <span class="comment">[We've met the INSTEAD rule before, but here we add a wrinkle with the WHEN clause. This lets us make the parser react differently under different circumstances. In this case, we want to prevent the interactor from leaving the building before getting the paper, to keep things from getting too complicated. (Thus, getting the paper becomes a puzzle to be solved before moving on to the next area.) So we use the WHEN clause to set a condition: we apply the INSTEAD only when the interactor doesn't have the paper. Note that this will also prevent the interactor from getting the paper, dropping it, then leaving. Basically, the paper is a ticket out of the building.]</span></p>
