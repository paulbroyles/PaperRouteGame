We can define them as Person, which is a generic term for any living organism that can act on its own: if there were animals in this game, we would declare them as people. We can also make a Man or Woman, which signifies a human person with a particular gender. Inform will give men and women the pronouns that typically correspond. I've defined some characters, including the character, in a gender-neutral manner and so make them people; others with specific gender are more precisely defined as men or women. Man and woman make no assumptions about age; male and female children would also be considered men and women.]</span></p>
