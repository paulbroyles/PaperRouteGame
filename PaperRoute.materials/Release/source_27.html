The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The [</span><span class="substitution">nameplate</span><span class="quote">] bears a name you don't recognize.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The nameplate is scenery in the foyeur. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">It's not your professor.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Some names are scenery in the foyeur. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">So many different names! Thank goodness you recognize your professor's among them.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The mailboxes are an open container in the foyeur. The mailboxes are not openable. They are not portable. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">box/boxes/mailbox</span>&quot; as the mailboxes. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The mailboxes are really more like little cubbies. You quickly find the one with your professor's name on it. It's empty, just like all the others.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">After inserting the paper into the mailboxes, say &quot;<span class="quote">You put you paper in the box bearing your professor's name. You really hope he finds it.</span>&quot; <span class="comment">[It's important to use AFTER here because the action of inserting changes the game world: before doing this, the paper is not in the box; after doing it, it is. Using &quot;instead&quot; would prevent that from happening, so that the player would still have the paper in his inventory.</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="comment">The phrasing &quot;inserting... into...&quot; may seem unnatural, but this is the way Inform words the action of putting something inside something else. I had to check the documentation to find that out. The player can just type &quot;put paper in mailbox,&quot; but we have to word it this way for Inform to understand.]</span></p><p class="indent0">Instead of going outside in the foyeur, try going south.</p>
