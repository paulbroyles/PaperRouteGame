The player can type ASK _____ about _____, and if it is one of the topics we have defined, receive a response. This system works for simple exchanges, but becomes unwieldy if there are many topics, and almost unusable in complicated circumstances where conversations branch or characters remember what has already been said. In those cases you will want to seek out a more advanced system for dialogue; several strong extensions have been written for that purpose. There are also systems slightly more sophisticated than this approach that use tables for dialogue; you will find examples in the Inform documentation.]</span></p><p class="indent0">Instead of asking the hard-working student about &quot;<span class="quote">bicycle/bike/cycle</span>&quot;:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">'If it's that much of an emergency, I'd let you borrow it,' she tells you.
