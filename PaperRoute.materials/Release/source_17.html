The description is &quot;<span class="quote">This printer is enormous! Clearly when it comes to technology, size does matter. [</span><span class="substitution">if the paper is in the printer</span><span class="quote">]Several pages are sitting in the tray.[</span><span class="substitution">else</span><span class="quote">]The tray is empty.[</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;. <span class="comment">[A CONTAINER is a new kind of object for us. Basically, it's an object that can contain other objects. When the interactor successfully prints the paper, we're going to place the paper in the printer, so making the printer a container lets us do that. But note that by default, interactors can add and remove things to containers freely, which means right now the player could put anything into the printer. We're going to fix that in the next step.]</span></p><p class="indent0">Instead of inserting something into the printer, say &quot;<span class="quote">You can't really say what has possessed you to want to put [</span><span class="substitution">the noun</span><span class="quote">] in the printer, but in any case, you aren't sure how you'd do that.</span>&quot; <span class="comment">[The words &quot;the noun&quot; mean the first noun that follows the verb, meaning those words will be replaced by whatever the interactor tries to put in the printer.]</span></p><p class="indent0">Instead of doing anything except examining to the printer, say &quot;<span class="quote">Actually, you can't do anything with the printer itself. You have to have a computer to print anything, and even the pay station is a separate device. Technology, huh?</span>&quot;</p>
