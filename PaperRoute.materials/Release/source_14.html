Maybe they need to invest some of that technology budget in English classes.</span>&quot; <span class="comment">[So, I made a joke in my room description. A very literal-minded interactor might take it too seriously and try to do something with the cash. By default, the parser would report that there are no stacks of cash--true, but not very helpful. It's better to explain what went wrong. We can't do that without actually creating the stacks of cash--ironically, the very thing we're trying to tell the interactor don't exist. To make sure the interactor can't do ANYTHING with them, we declare them to be invisible--that means they won't show up in room descriptions.]</span></p><p class="indent0">Some computers are scenery in the computer lab. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The computers that fill the room are gorgeous, with large, bright, glassy screens. You think you can see last term's tuition over there on the far side of the room.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of doing anything except examining to the computers, say &quot;<span class="quote">Your paper isn't on any of those computers, so you don't see how it can do any good.</span>&quot;</p>
