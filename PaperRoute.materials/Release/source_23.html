<p class="indent0"><span class="heading">Chapter 3 - Construction zone</span></p><p class="indent0">A room called Construction zone is north of grassy area. &quot;<span class="quote">A [</span><span class="substitution">footpath</span><span class="quote">] stretches to the north, running directly between your dorm and your professor's office building. Currently, that path is blocked by a bright orange [</span><span class="substitution">barricade</span><span class="quote">]. Past the barricade, the path is torn up; enormous [</span><span class="substitution">construction equipment</span><span class="quote">] looms over the cratered way. Walls prevent passage to either side; the only way to go is back to the south.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of going north in construction zone, say &quot;<span class="quote">No, the path has been utterly demolished by whatever construction they're doing. You'll have to find another way.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">A footpath is scenery in construction zone. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">Once a pleasant little footpath that made a nice shortcut that wound its way across a rarely-used part of campus, it has been completely destroyed by whatever campus construction push is going on these days. You haven't heard what they're planning to build, but you have a sinking feeling that it won't be as nice as what's there.</span>&quot; Understand &quot;<span class="quote">path</span>&quot; as the footpath.</p><p class="indent0">A barricade is scenery in construction zone. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">You know those little orange cones, not even knee high, that people put up when there's a bottomless hole or deadly quagmire or something? This isn't one of those. It's a hulking concrete barrier almost as high as your shoulders, painted screaming orange, and stretching the whole way across the path. Whoever put it up is very determined: you're not going back there.</span>&quot; Understand &quot;<span class="quote">barrier</span>&quot; as the barricade.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of climbing the barricade, say &quot;<span class="quote">It's too tall, and the sides have no handholds. You'd never make it.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Some construction equipment is scenery in construction zone. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">You can never remember the names for all the different kinds of construction equipment, but it hardly matters: all of them are here, and huge, and yellow. They've completely destroyed the path.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of doing anything except examining to the construction equipment, say &quot;<span class="quote">You can't get to the equipment, since you can't cross the barricade. Even if you could, you're pretty sure messing with it would get you arrested or expelled. You're not sure which would be worse at this point.</span>&quot;</p>
