The description is &quot;<span class="quote">It's hard to know after such a late night if it's any good, but it exists, and that's what matters. [</span><span class="substitution">if the paper is stapled</span><span class="quote">]The pages are neatly stapled together; it looks beautiful and ready to turn in.[</span><span class="substitution">otherwise</span><span class="quote">]The loose pages are stacked haphazardly.[</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;. The paper is nowhere. The paper can be queued. The paper can be printed. The paper can be found. The paper can be stapled. The paper can be late. <span class="comment">[Some of the actions we'll introduce in Book 2 require the existence of the paper. From the perspective of the player, the paper doesn't exist until it's printed; she creates it by printing it. But it's not possible to create a new object in the middle of an Inform game (except using complicated techniques). Instead, we tell Inform that the paper exists, but that it's nowhere; you already saw above how we move it to the printer when we're ready for it. The designers of the language compare this to theatre: the paper is a prop kept off-stage until called for by a scene. </span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="comment">The &quot;can be&quot; statements tell Inform that the paper has certain properties. None of these are true when the game begins, but in the course of play, we give the paper each of these properties.]</span></p><p class="indent0">Understand &quot;<span class="quote">pages/papers</span>&quot; as the paper. <span class="comment">[This allows the player to type reasonable synonyms for the paper.]</span></p>
