The bus is outbound. <span class="comment">[While before we've defined some optional properties, here we define an either/or property: the bus will always be either inbound or outbound. We must change this status as appropriate.]</span></p><p class="indent0">Instead of going a direction while the player is in the bus, say &quot;<span class="quote">Let the bus driver handle the navigation. The only thing you have to do is get off at the right stop.</span>&quot; <span class="comment">[Inform by default treats vehicles as &quot;driven&quot; by the player, so that the player's movements cause the vehicle to move. Since the bus is autonomous, we override that behavior by preventing movement while the player is on the bus.]</span></p><p class="indent0">Instead of entering the bus when the player does not have the ID card, say &quot;<span class="quote">You have to have your ID card to be able to board the campus busses.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The driver is a person in the bus. He is scenery. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The driver is focused on the road.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Every turn: <span class="comment">[Unlike everything else in our game, the bus has a life of its own: it makes its circuit between the office and the dorm whether the player is interacting with it or not. EVERY TURN rules let us specify things that happen every turn, no matter what. If we wanted to perform these actions only when certain conditions are met, we could use an EVERY TURN WHEN... rule instead.]</span></p><p class="indent1">if the bus is in Office lawn for the third turn: <span class="comment">[&quot;for the third turn&quot; in this case means for the third turn IN A ROW. So, the bus will arrive, wait two turns, and depart.]</span></p><p class="indent2">now the bus is inbound;</p><p class="indent2">try the bus going southeast; <span class="comment">[You've seen this before, but I haven't explained it yet. TRY is how we tell something in the game to do something during code; as the Inform documentation says, the word &quot;try&quot; is meant to indicate that the action may not be successful -- that is, something might prevent the bus from going southeast.]</span></p><p class="indent1">otherwise if the bus is in Grassy area for the third turn:</p><p class="indent2">now the bus is outbound;</p><p class="indent2">try the bus going northeast;</p><p class="indent1">otherwise if the bus is in the road:</p><p class="indent2">if the bus is inbound:</p><p class="indent3">try the bus going southwest;</p><p class="indent2">otherwise:</p><p class="indent3">try the bus going northwest.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of getting off the bus: try exiting. <span class="comment">[Inform interprets &quot;get off&quot; to mean stop standing atop something.
