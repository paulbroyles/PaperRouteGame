This Book has to come first because of the New Types listed below. In that section, we're telling Inform about some new kinds of object that it doesn't know about. We have to tell it about those types before we create any objects belonging to them, which we'll do in describing the bedroom. But the techniques we're using here are more advanced than some of what follows, and this section will probably be more intelligible after you're familiar with the Settings.]</span></p>
