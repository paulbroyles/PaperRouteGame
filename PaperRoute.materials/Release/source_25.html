Yes, it's an old house. It's also an office building. Just one of the oddities you might run into on a campus that's slowly eating up its town.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The white house is scenery in office lawn. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">It's a fairly small white house with a [</span><span class="substitution">front door</span><span class="quote">] made of wood. It looks old. It feels allusive.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">A closed lockable locked door called the front door is north from office lawn. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">A black wooden door breaks the white smoothness of the front of the house. There's no swipe box here, just an old-fashioned lock.</span>&quot; The front door has matching key the office key.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of going inside when the player is in office lawn, try going north. <span class="comment">[When presented a house, it's very reasonable to want to go inside it. Here we are using compass directions, but we can translate an effort to go inside into going north instead. Note that we need to do the same thing in reverse in the adjoining rool, as we do below.]</span></p><p class="indent0">The office key is an object. &quot;<span class="quote">A small key is lying [</span><span class="substitution">if the key is in Outdoors</span><span class="quote">]in the grass[</span><span class="substitution">otherwise</span><span class="quote">]on the floor[</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">].</span>&quot; The description is &quot;<span class="quote">It's a small, very plain-looking key.</span>&quot; The office key is nowhere. <span class="comment">[The if statements in the initial description are necessary because the player might carry the key indoors and then drop it, which would add it to the locale description.]</span></p><p class="indent1"></p><p class="indent0">Does the player mean unlocking the front door with the key: it is likely. Does the player mean opening the front door: it is likely.</p>
